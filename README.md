# meteo_forcing_wrfhydro
Project Title Meteorological forcing data for NWM/WRF-Hydro Collaborators on this project Yin-Phan Tsang and Yu-Fen Huang The problem Meteorological forcings are important to any hydrological model, yet inherit data formats are required for different models. Our team propose to prepare meteorological forcings for WRF-Hydro, the core process of National Water Model (NWM). WRF-Hydro team has provided regridding scripts for data from NLDAS, HRRR, MRMS, GFS, and RAP. However, these data sources are not always available for the desired study regions (e.g., regions outside of Contiguous United State) or in certain cases ground observation could be supplemented and enhance the quality of meteorological forcings. We would like to build a script or package to use WRF-Hydro with available meteorological datasets that might be different from the available default data sources.
