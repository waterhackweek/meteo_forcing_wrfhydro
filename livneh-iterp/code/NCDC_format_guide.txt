                           (PRIMARILY U.S.)

                     National Climatic Data Center
                           151 Patton Ave.
                       Asheville, North Carolina
 

Field numbers are shown with column positions in parenthesis.

FIELD 1 (1-4): DATA ORIGIN

The original NCDC tapedeck of the dataset.  Referred to in some of the tables
below.
*** Important Note:  If tapedeck number is 3201 or 3202, this indicates the data
are preliminary, with less quality control applied than the final data
(indicated by 3200 or 3210).  The 3201/02 data are replaced online by the final
data as soon as final data are available. ***


FIELD 2 (6-11): COOPERATIVE STATION NUMBER

This 6-character alphanumeric station identifier is assigned by the
National Climatic Data Center.  The first two digits refer to a state
code (value range is 01-91; reference Table "A").  The next four
digits refer to the Cooperative Network Index number (value range
is 0001-9999).  Missing/not assigned = 999999.


FIELD 3 (13-17): WBAN STATION NUMBER

This 5-character alphanumeric station identifier is assigned by the
National Climatic Data Center.  It originally referred to Weather Bureau,
Army, and Navy (WBAN) stations which mailed weather observational forms to
NCDC.  These stations normally have more detailed data available than strictly
cooperative stations, so stations with WBAN numbers will usually have
additional data elements.


Optional Field (19 - 48):  STATION NAME

This 30-character alphanumberic field is displayed if the data selection is
for data with Station Name.  Spacing for all fields following are adjusted
31 characters (e.g., Division Number = 50-51).


FIELD 4 (19-20): DIVISION NUMBER

These two digits refer to the Cooperative Network Division Number (value range
is 01-10; 99 = missing Division Number; reference Table "B").

    Code.  Speed expressed in miles per hour.  Example of value field
    XXYYY for wind direction and speed:  18045; 18 = wind direction
    from 169 degrees to 191 degrees.  045 = wind speed 45 miles per
    hour.  FSMN is not digitized for Air Weather Service Stations.

    23 hours and 59 minutes.
 
    PKGS
    Peak Gust Direction and Speed.  If two or more equal peak gust
    speeds occurred on the same day, the first was digitized for the
    period July, 1968 through December 1972.  Beginning in January
    1973, the last was digitized.  The direction is generally
    expressed in 16 Point WBAN Code, with the following exceptions:
 
    (1)  Air Force stations used 36 Point code from January, 1964
    through February, 1967, 16 Point WBAN Code from March, 1967
    through June, 1968, and 36 Point code again from July, 1968
    through December, 1970.  Air Force data was generally
    discontinued by December, 1970.
     
    (2)  Navy stations used 16 Point WBAN Code from the beginning of
    record through January, 1971, and 36 Point Code from February,
    1971 through the present.
 
    Wind speeds are generally expressed in miles per hour through
    December,  1954, and in knots from January, 1955 to the present.
    A  consistent exception is Navy stations, which used knots for
    the entire period of record.  Example of value field XXYYY after
    1954 for wind direction and speed:  44032; 44 = Wind direction
    from the SE.  032 = Wind speed 032 knots.
 
    Beginning July 1996, wind direction is expressed in 36 Point
    WBAN Code (Reference Table "F2").

    incorrectly recorded as DT (wind direction in tens of degrees).
    It should be DW (wind direction in whole degrees).
 
    RWND
    Resultant Wind Speed (begin 1984).  DATA-VALUE is expressed in
    miles per hour to tenths.  From January 1984 through June 1987,
    the Meteorological Element Measurement Units Code is incorrectly
    recorded as TK (tenths of knots) and incorrectly recored as MH
    (miles per hour) from July 1987 through late 1994. It should be
    TL tenths of miles per hour.

FIELD 6 (27-28): METEOROLOGICAL ELEMENT MEASUREMENT UNITS CODE
 
The units and decimal position (precision) of the data value for this record
(reference Table "K"). See "Known Uncorrected Problems" for additional
details.
 

FIELD 7 (30-35): YEAR-MONTH
 
This is the year and month of the data record.  Range of values is
1850-current year and 01-12.  Example: 199512 = December 1995.


FIELD 8 (37-40): DAY OF MONTH and HOUR OF OBSERVATION
 
DAY: The day of the month on which the data element was observed.
Range of values is 01-31 LST.  Will always begin with day 01 and end with day
31.

HOUR OF OBSERVATION: Contains the hour of the daily observation.  Hour of
observation is reported using the 24-hour clock with values ranging from 00-23
LST, except in the cases of soil temperatures element-type (where the hour
is 99 to indicate missing) and "days with weather" (where the hour is
24).  Through June 1967 observations were designated as "AM" or "PM";
these values were set to 06 or 18 respectively during the conversion to
TD-3200.  From July 1967 through 1981, all observations were set to
hour 18 (because the majority are p.m. observations).  Beginning January
1982, the actual hour of the observation is indicated. 


FIELD 9 (42-47): SIGN AND VALUE OF METEOROLOGICAL ELEMENT
 
SIGN: The algebraic sign of the meteorological data value is given as either
a blank or a minus sign (-).  Blank indicates a positive value and a
minus sign represents a negative value.
 
VALUE OF METEOROLOGICAL ELEMENT
 
The actual data value is given as a five-digit integer.  One major
exception does exist however, for the DYSW (days with weather code)
element-type values as explained in Table "D".  A very small number
of data values are known to have non-numeric entries.
 
When a data value is missing, the sign of the data value is set to "-", the
data value is set to "99999", flag position 1 is set to "M" and flag position
2 is blank.
 
Prior to September 1991, when no daily precipitation reading was taken
but the amount from that day (if any) is included in a subsequent value,
the data value of precipitation is set equal to "00000" and flagged with
an "S" in flag position 1.  In turn, the successive accumulated amount
will be flagged with an "A" in flag position 1.  Since September 1991,
it has been a practice at NCDC to set the precipitation value to
"99999" in this situation; the flagging procedure has not changed.

 
FIELD 10 (49-49): FLAG1
 
The Data Measurement FLAG (reference Table "N").  This field will not be 
present if the user chooses a delimited format without data flags.

 
FIELD 11 (51-51): FLAG2

The Data Quality FLAG (reference Table "O").  This field will not be 
present if the user chooses a delimited format without data flags.


FIELDS 8-11 are then repeated for each day of the month, beginning with 01 in
the DAY field, and ending with 31 in the DAY field.  So, the data for DAY 02
will occupy columns 53-67, DAY 03 = 69-83, etc.

From 1980 forward, these two-character DYSW
element-type codes are stored into the
rightmost four characters of the data value
portion of the meteorological element.
Within the four characters used, the
weather codes are entered left justified.
Thus, if one type of weather occurs during
a day, the data values would appear as
OXXOO, where XX is the appropriate weather
code.  If two types of weather occur, the
data value will contain OXXYY, where XX is
value 1 and YY is value 2.  If more than
two types of weather occur on the same day,
they will be stored into additional "DLY"
records of the element-type code "DYSW" as
needed.
 
NOTE:  Prior to 1980, each weather code for
DYSW is written as a unique DATA PORTION.
Only the left position (XX) of the DYSW
code is used (e.g., appears as OXXOO).

KNOWN UNCORRECTED PROBLEMS AND DATA CAVEATS:

For maximum and minimum temperature, from 1990 - 1994, the value
is often shown as missing if FIELD 1 = 3210 and the temperature was
reported as -10 F or lower.  NCDC will attempt to correct this problem
as soon as resources allow.

For snowfall and snow depth data:  For July 1996 to present, this element
is not valid and should not be used if FIELD 1 = 3210.  NCDC will
attempt to correct this problem as soon as resources allow.

For October 1990, there are numerous duplicate data records in
the daily data.  In using the data, choose the data record with
the most daily values for the month.

During the period 1984-86 there are numerous entries for element
PRCP of "NA" for the Meteorological Element Units Code.  These
should be coded as "HI".
 
In 1988 for states 31-91 (North Carolina to Pacific Islands), the
algebraic sign of positive meteorological data values may be coded
as "+" symbols instead of as blanks.
 
The historical data were converted from existing digital files and
placed in the element structure format in 1983.  At that time these
data were only processed through a gross value check.  In January
1984, NCDC instituted greatly enhanced computer algorithms for
automated validation of digital archives.  The revised edit system
performs internal consistency checks, climatological limits checks
and serial checks.  It is the goal of the NCDC that, as resources
permit, these historical files will be brought up to the same level
of quality as those from 1984 onward.
 
Quality control "flags" are appended to each element to show how
they fared during the edit procedures and to indicate what, if any,
action was taken. 
 
The typical progression of temperature instruments was from
liquid-in-glass thermometers, to (1960 series) Hygrothermometers,
to (1980 series) Hygrothermometers.  Scientists are currently
investigating the effect these instrument changes (especially
the 1980 series) may have on long term temperature records.

Users should also be aware of a potential for a "lag" in the change of
observation times used in the logical record and what is actually in practice
at the site (that is, several months may be archived digitally under an "old"
observation time before NCDC received notification).
 
Prior to the 1970's, accumulated amounts of precipitation were not always
flagged with the "A".  Instead the convention was to treat the value following
a series of data values flagged with "S" as an accumulated value.
 
A very small number of data values are known to have non-numeric entries.
 
Maximum and Minimum Temperature--
 
National Weather Service, and Federal Aviation Stations:  These
values are determined from stations equipped with maximum and
minimum thermometers or recording instruments.  For some sites,
when instruments were inoperative, values were selected from
hourly observations.

Maximum and Minimum Relative Humidity--

For the period July 1996 through December 1998, the twenty four (24) hour
maximum and minimum relative humilities reported as 00000 and 00100
respectively, are incorrect.  These values were incorrectly generated for
stations that did not report relative humidity.
 
U.S. Air Force Stations:  From May 15, 1955, for stations taking 24
record observations per day, the maximum and minimun temperatures
are determined from hourly observations.  The observations at the
beginning and ending of day are considered.  The values are
reported as missing when more than 3 of the hourly observations
pertinent to the determination of maximum and minimum temperatures
for each 24-hour period are missing or erroneous.
 
U.S. Navy Stations:  When maximum and minimum thermometer readings
are not available, the data at most stations are reported as
missing.  Some Navy stations determine the maximum and minimum
temperatures from hourly observations when readings from maximum
and minimum thermometers are not available.
 
Hail and Snowfall Amounts--
 
Although the inclusion of hail amounts with snowfall amounts was
discontinued after December 31, 1955, some stations may have hail
amounts included with snowfall after this date, as late as 1963 at
a few stations.  This occurred because on the original manuscript
form the same column was used for the entry of snow, sleet and hail,
and the entry was not indicated as hail.  For NWS sites, hail was
again included in snowfall amounts beginning in 1989.

Confidence Factors--
 
Days with Weather Code:  The "days with weather" element-type (DYSW) cannot be
used with any measure of confidence when FIELD 1 = 3200.  Principal
climatological stations operating 24 hours a day are expected to be the most
reliable source of "days with weather".  Reporting of this element by
cooperative observers is not a requirement and criteria for reporting is not
definitive.  Most cooperative stations do not record this information.
